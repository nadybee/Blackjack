This is my BlackJack game for practice.

Things I would like to improve:
    Little effort has been put into styling as I haven't studied CSS yet, except for the basics. I would like to add animations, and button states etc. As well as over all curb appeal.

    I feel like I am repeating code, and I'm sure here is an easier way to to handle the Ace card. I feel like I made it way too complicated, but it works!

    I feel like I am not fully understanding the benefits of classes in OOP and stand to learn more about it to make my code more concise.  Should I have more classes in this game?
    
    I seem to have a lot of global functions. Seems like bad pratice? Looking to improve. Also looking to improve overall organization.

    When I started, I spent HOURS on trying to figure out how to create the array of cards to make the deck. I could easily make 52 cards with a value and suit using loops, but couldn't figure out to add the associated images. So I just did it manually.  Now I think I could use a getter and setter (which I didn't understand till half way through this project) to do the images, but I don't see the benefit of doing that now, unless I wanted to change the look of the cards. 

    This is what to add still:

    •   option to split on doubles and play two hands
    •   when deck is out, shuffle the deck and keep playing instead of ending the game.
    •   animations and timeouts when the cards are dealt
    •   button states
    •   potientally add more denominations of bets 20,40,80,100, all in.
